        <p>A watch is a small clock carried or worn by a person. It makes it easy to see the time. 
            It is also a fashion accessory for men and women, and expensive watches are designed for this purpose. 
            A watch may be one of the few accessories worn by a person.
            A wristwatch is designed to be worn on a wrist, attached by a strap or other type of bracelet.
            A pocket watch is to be carried in a pocket. There are other variations. Nurses often wear a watch attached to the front of their uniform. 
It hangs down from a short strap: when lifted by the user it is right side up.</p>

            <br>All of us have a watch that we are fond of. To own a watch was a great desire for me from a very young age.
<br>I have seen my friends wearing watches of different colors and shapes and so when I asked my parents, they were willing to get me a watch. For my birthday, they presented me my watch, my first watch!!!
<br>The watch that I got was really beautifully and trendy. <br>
It was the Ben 10 watch, which I am very fond of.<br> 
It is red in color and has beautiful Ben 10 pictures on it, along the straps and on the dial. 
<br>The dial is round and has a photo of Ben 10 embossed on it.<br>
Inside the dial, the base is white in color. 
<br>The numbers in the dial are all fluorescent and therefore it glows at night.
<br>The minute needle and the secondâ€™s needle also have their tips translucent, so at night, even that glows.
The most attractive feature of my watch is the flexibility of the strap.
